description: Review Criteria for Extension 03 - Vue2
---

- Read the pull request body.
- If the "Type of Work" is Extension and the "Topic" is "03 - Vue 2" then apply the criterion below for this review. Otherwise do not apply this criteria in your review.
- Review web-projects/flashword/index.html and web-projects/flashword/app.js checking for the content in the following sections:

## Workflow

- The pull request contains at least three commits.
- The commit messages briefly describe the changes made in the commit.

## Non-AI Extensions

- The "Reset" button is disabled whenever the `text` input is empty.
- There are 2 CSS rules in `index.html` that set the background-color to different colors.
- There is a Vue `computed` property that returns the name of the CSS class to be applied to the `text` input based on the value of `hasError`.
- The `text` input is styled by binding a CSS `class` to a Vue `computed` property.

## Extensions with AI

- A `watch` on `answer` clears the error styling on the `text` input when the user starts typing an answer.
- The flashword app contains a badge feature that displays the image of a badge when the percent of a user's answers that are correct is at least 80 percent.
- At least one of the commits in the pull request contains an `Assisted-by:` trailer acknowledging the use of an AI model or tool as required by the workflow.
- The pull request has at least one comment containing a log of the author's interaction with GitHub Copilot as required by the workflow. This comment can be identified because it contains a top level heading of "Copilot Chat Log" and a hash hidden in an HTML comment.

## AI Reflection

- The pull request has a comment that responds to each of the questions posed under the heading "AI Reflection" in the issue associated with the pull request. Responses must contain more than a restatement of the question in order to satisfy this criteria.

- If you applied this criteria, skip all other path specific instructions.
